I may have caught the 'write an emulator' bug. This is just a place holder for
now. The plan is to write a simple emulator of an Intel 4004. I'll add some
memory mapped io for a display. Probably character based at this point.

Testing the emulator will require ROM images which seem fairly scarce. I'll make
some ROMs using the assembler located [here][szyc].
